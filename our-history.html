        <h2 class="subtitle">Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine living in France in the early 19th century, after the chaos
          and violence of the French Revolution. The Church is in disarray, the
          people are in need of hope and guidance, and the society is in
          transition. In this turbulent time, a young priest named Basile Moreau
          has a dream: to form a new religious community of priests, brothers,
          and sisters who would work together to educate and evangelize the
          people of France and beyond.
        </p>
        <img src="/ab-1.jpg" alt="History" class="right" />
        <p>
          Moreau was born in 1799 in Laign√©-en-Belin, a small village near Le
          Mans. He grew up in a devout Catholic family and felt called to the
          priesthood from an early age. He entered the seminary in 1814 and was
          ordained in 1821. He soon became a professor of theology and
          philosophy at the seminary of Le Mans, where he impressed his students
          and colleagues with his intelligence, piety, and charisma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreau had a vision of a religious community that would combine the
          apostolic zeal of the Jesuits, the simplicity and humility of the
          Franciscans, and the devotion and tenderness of the Montfortians. He
          wanted his community to be modeled after the Holy Family of Jesus,
          Mary, and Joseph, and to have the cross as its symbol and hope. He
          also wanted his community to be open to the signs of the times and to
          the needs of the Church and the world.
        </p>

      <div id="mission-content">
        <h2 class="subtitle">Our Mission</h2>
        <img src="/dibosh-grp.jpg" alt="Mission" class="left" />
        <p>
          Our mission is to be faithful disciples of Jesus Christ, who came to
          proclaim the good news to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to set
          the captives free, and to bring hope to the world. We are inspired by
          the words of our founder, who said: "We are not here to do great
          things, but to do small things with great love."
        </p>
        <p>
          We seek to live out our mission through our vows of poverty, chastity,
          and obedience, which express our total commitment to God and to our
          brothers and sisters in the congregation and in the world. We also
          seek to live out our mission through our charism, which is the gift of
          the Holy Spirit that animates our life and ministry.
        </p>
        <div class="clear"></div>
      </div>
      <div id="vows-content">
        <h2 class="subtitle">Our Vows</h2>
        <p>
          Our vows are the expression of our love for God and for our neighbor.
          They are the means by which we conform ourselves to Christ and share
          in his mission. They are also the source of our joy and freedom, as we
          rely on God's grace and providence.
        </p>
        <img src="/fest.jpg" alt="Vows" class="right" />
        <p>
          We profess the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, following the
          evangelical counsels that Jesus taught and lived. By the vow of
          poverty, we renounce the ownership of material goods and share
          everything in common, trusting in God's generosity and care. By the
          vow of chastity, we dedicate our whole being to God and to the service
          of his people, living in celibacy and in fraternal love. By the vow of
          obedience, we listen to God's will and to the voice of the Church,
          submitting ourselves to the authority of our superiors and to the
          common good of the congregation.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Our Charism</h2>
        <img src="/first-profn-2023.jpg" alt="Charism" class="left" />
        <p>
          Our charism is the gift of the Holy Spirit that gives us a distinctive
          identity and mission in the Church. Our charism is to be a sign of the
          cross, the symbol of God's love and mercy for the world. We are called
          to embrace the cross in our own lives, to share in the sufferings of
          Christ and of his people, and to witness to the power of the
          resurrection and the hope of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our charism also impels us to be a sign of unity, the fruit of the
          cross. We are called to foster communion among ourselves, among the
          members of the Church, and among all people of good will. We are
          called to promote dialogue, reconciliation, and peace in a divided and
          wounded world.

      <div id="vocation-content">
        <h2 class="subtitle">Our Vocation</h2>
        <p>
          Our vocation is to be holy, as God is holy. We are called to follow
          Jesus Christ, the way, the truth, and the life, and to imitate his
          virtues and attitudes. We are called to be faithful to the Gospel, to
          the teachings of the Church, and to the spirit of our founder. We are
          called to be men and women of prayer, of service, and of mission.
        </p>
        <img src="/photo2_MG_7487.jpg" alt="Vocation" class="right" />
        <p>
          Our vocation is also to be apostolic, as Jesus was sent by the Father.
          We are called to share in the mission of Christ, who came to save the
          world and to make all things new. We are called to use our gifts and
          talents for the glory of God and for the good of his people. We are
          called to be co-workers with the Holy Spirit, who guides and empowers
          us for our ministry.

        <p>
          Our prayer life is the foundation and the nourishment of our vocation.
          We pray to praise and thank God, to ask for his help and forgiveness,
          to intercede for the needs of the Church and the world, and to listen
          to his voice and his will. We pray individually and communally, in
          private and in public, in silence and in words, in action and in
          contemplation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pray according to the liturgy of the Church, especially the
          Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours, which are the sources and the
          summits of our spiritual life. We also pray according to the
          traditions of our congregation, such as the rosary, the stations of
          the cross, the novena to the Sacred Heart, and the spiritual exercises
          of St. Ignatius. We also pray according to our personal preferences
          and needs, such as meditation, lectio divina, adoration, and spiritual
          reading.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Our Community Life</h2>
        <p>
          Our community life is the expression and the support of our vocation.
          We live together as brothers and sisters, sharing our joys and
          sorrows, our strengths and weaknesses, our hopes and fears. We live
          together as friends, respecting and appreciating each other's
          diversity, personality, and gifts. We live together as disciples,
          following the same Lord and Master, and striving to grow in holiness
          and in apostolic zeal.
        </p>
        <img src="/img/bg3.jpg" alt="Community" class="right" />
        <p>
          We live according to the rule of life of our congregation, which
          outlines the principles and practices of our common life. We also live
          according to the guidance of our superiors, who are the servants and
          the leaders of our communities. We also live according to the needs
          and the opportunities of our ministry, which may require us to adapt
          and to be flexible in our community arrangements.
